## My process

For this project, I opted to render the page using the Javascript DOM to render it with ```literal strings``` and variables,
so it emulate what libraries such as React do to render the websites, tough its very simple. Its is still possible to improve the code, such as consuming an API to render the contries images, game polls and event dates.

### Built with

- HTML and CSS
- Javascript
- Git and Github

### What I learned

### Continued development

Studing and understanding better CSS and HTML properties;
